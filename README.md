# ACMT Travel
An application used to document restaurants, bars and activities in the cities my boyfriend and I travel to. Built using React.

## Purpose

I created this application to practice a set of technical skills. They include:
* React Router
* Different ways to implement APIs
* Styling without using CSS library

## Project Status
I have completed the bulk of the technical part of this app, but do plan to implement changes to better the user experience. These include:
- [ ] Image responsiveness on home page

- [ ] Editing Yelp search on city pages to have a default city entered for search

- [ ] Creating a favicon

Additionally, because this project was to practice technical skills, much of the content is still dummy text from my favorite [Loren Ipsum generator](https://pirateipsum.me/). I will be updating this to include real information soon!

## Reflection

This is a project I built to practice using React and fetching information from APIs (in this case, [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) and [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3)). I also wanted to try React Router for routing.

I wanted to build an application that allowed users to not only view my favorite places to go in my favorite cities, but also give them the opportunity to discover new places for themselves. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate.


--------------

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
